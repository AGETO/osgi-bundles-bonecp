/**

 * will generally want to extend {@link com.jolbox.bonecp.hooks.AbstractConnectionHook} instead to provide a 
 * default implementation. Applications might also want to make use of 
 * connection.setDebugHandle(...) to keep track of additional information on 
 * each connection.
 * 
 *  Since the class is eventually loaded via reflection, the implementation must 
 *  provide a public, no argument constructor.
 *  
 *  Warning: Be careful to make sure that the hook methods are re-entrant and
 *  thread-safe; do not rely on external state without appropriate locking, use appropriate 
 *  synchronization!
